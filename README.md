<h1>🧑🏻‍💻 Hi! My name is Elizaveta and I'm an aspiring frontend-dev</h1>

 I’m currently learning MERN stack, especially interested in Express and MongoDB🍃,
 also started learning about SEO 🔍 :)
  Looking to collaborate on any beginner-friendly projects based on React/Typescript!

On the side I do a little bit of design and drawing, see my works at https://vk.com/shoshuu_u and https://vk.com/public207185473
